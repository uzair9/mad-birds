## Notes

**Sprite Tiling:** This is like the `background-repeat: 'repeat';` property of CSS. Using sprite tiling, we can repeat the background without having to copy-paste our sprites again and again. For this, we select the `Draw Mode` to `Tile` in our Sprite Renderer. Afterwards, in `Rect Mode` we can drag and repeat the background with ease.

**Layers:** We can use layers to set the visibility of several objects. It is like the `z-index` property of CSS. Here, the layer with a smaller number has a smaller z-index, and, therfore, it will be displayed behind the other layer.

**Animations:** Here, we have to add `Animator` compoenent to the object. Then, we have to create the animation. Finally, we drag and drop it to the animator component and set the mode to `always` to make our objects always switch back and forth to create an animation effect.
